# Welcome to MineAndSeek!

MineAndSeek is a minigame datapack designed by EternalLawn and implemented by LordKanelsnegle. It is intended for personal use, but we anticipate its growth and welcome the opporunity for matchmaking, player statistics, and the ability to play any time.

# Game Design

The premise of the game offers a dangerously fun spin on hide and seek, with players having access to specialized classes that can shift the tides of victory with their unique abilities. Players are divided into two factions, "Hunters" and "Survivors", and spend up to 10 minutes in precreated maps trying to achieve victory for their faction. 
- Hunters are designed with the sole intent of seeking and defeating Survivors; they win if they can defeat all Survivors before time runs out.
- Survivors are designed to befuddle Hunters, and protect themselves and their allies; they win if they at least one Survivor lives when time runs out.

## Hunters (Experimental)

<details>
  <summary>Clyde: The Savage</summary>

<details>

The animals and spirits became were merciful to her when her life wasn’t and became her family.

  > There was once a kingdom that was plagued with snow born from the frigid queen’s heart. She locked away her daughter, leaving her with nothing but the neverending snow on her balcony and her imagination.

# Folders

All of the folders of interest are in `data/mas`, so assume all folders discussed are in that directory unless otherwise specified.

## Functions

This folder contains chunks of code known as "functions", which can be run individually. Some of these are called every tick while others are called at specific times.

### Classes
Contains functions for each of the classes, separated into `hunter` and `survivor` folders. These include their respective abilities and kits.

### Game
Contains functions pertaining to joining/leaving the game and moderator commands in case something goes wrong.

### Logic
Contains the functions that control the flow of the game, such as the code for initializing rounds or cleaning up after they're done.

### Scripts
Contains the functions needed for installing/uninstalling the datapack, these shouldn't need to change too often. Any variables or scoreboards and such that are needed for the game to work properly should be initialized in the `install` function and removed in the `uninstall` function.

## Structures

This folder contains the structures needed to load the different maps at the beginning of every round. For now, it's not actually used, but in the future it might be useful to have the datapack itself control the structures for portability or to allow other users to contribute their own maps.

## Tags

This folder contains the tags used to group different things together, such as functions or blocks. At the moment we only use the tags to group together the functions needed for setting up the datapack, though in the future they could be used for other things. For instance, rather than checking for 5 different block types individually, you could group them and check for a specific tag.


# To-Do

The to-do's of this project are ever-changing, but this is a tentative list of what work there is to be done.

## Bugs

Any bug fixes that are within our control can be found here. These are generally high priority.
- Example

## Balancing

Any balancing changes that need to be made can be found here. These are generally medium priority.
- Example

## New Concepts

Any new ideas or WIP classes/abilities/etc can be found here. These are generally low priority.
- Example

## Caveats
Any bugs or issues that are version-dependent or faults with Minecraft itself can be found here. They won't be actively worked on, but are worth noting for future reference in case they eventually get fixed.
- Example

# Coding Conventions

There are some very important coding conventions that need to be adhered to, such as the naming of certain variables or tags. These will be updated as time goes on and are currently as follows:
- All tag, scoreboard, and variable names should be prefixed with `mas.` to reduce chance of conflict with other datapacks
- Dummy variables in scoreboards should be prefixed with # to avoid accidentally setting values for players with the same name - even if players won't be added to that list
- Use `_` to join multiple words in a variable name, e.g. `#round_timer` NOT `#round.timer`
- Constant values should be set up as enums rather than being hardcoded, using the correct section of `mas.enums`, and must be CAPS_CASE to indicate that they are constants
- Every file should have a comment describing it at the top, and comments dividing the functionality into sections. Otherwise, comments are only needed when the code is not self-explanatory
- All entities spawned by the datapack MUST have the tag `mas.entity` for cleanup. VERY IMPORTANT!
- Try to keep things self-contained; namely, map related things should ONLY be used within map files, such as the `#map` enum
- Always use `type` and `limit` (where applicable) for entity searches, even if it's a situation where doing so feels redundant
- Respect `global.ignore` flags when selecting entities without MaS-specific tags - more info [here](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/conventions/global_ignoring_tag.html)
