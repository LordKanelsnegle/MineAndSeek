# START
#  Purpose:
#    Initiates the locker phase of the game, in which players choose their classes.
#  End Effect:
#    Updates the game state, assigns the teams, triggers the setup function corresponding to the chosen map, 
#    TP's the players to the lockers, shows them messages, inits the pregame music and xp timers, then schedules 
#    the function for spawning the Survivors into the map.
#  Called by:
#    players/start
#  Additional notes:
#    The TP's and messages could be split into two team_init functions to avoid using the same selector
#    several times, which may be more efficient. Same goes for the selector checks in player setup.
#    TODO (medium): Return to this.
